Miro,
    Yes, I am the right person to ask. The website and code is mine alone,
and no one else is or has been involved. SoftSurfer is a registered DBA
name I have been using. However, in the past year, I have rehosted and
refactored the softsurfer.com site to geomalgorithms.com.

Your request is reasonable. For use in RepSnapper, the copyright statement
for any code on my site can now read:

// Copyright 2001 softSurfer, 2012-13 Dan Sunday
// This code may be freely used, distributed and modified for any
// purpose providing that this copyright notice is included with it.
// SoftSurfer makes no warranty for this code, and cannot be held
// liable for any real or imagined damage resulting from its use.
// Users of this code must verify correctness for their application.

I will likely make this wording change on the website.

One small request. If you make any significant modifications to the code
that would improve the code presented on my site, I would appreciate it if
you would send them to me (only if you want to).

Best Wishes,
Dan Sunday

RepSnapper uses some functions copyrighted as above [1].<br>

The problem, that Fedora care about, is that there is no explicit permissio=
